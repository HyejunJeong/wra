      "Benefits of Smart Doorbells\n",
      "Remote Monitoring: With a smart doorbell, you can monitor your doorstep from anywhere using your smartphone or tablet. This allows you to see who’s at your door even when you’re not home, providing an added layer of security and convenience.\n",
      "Two-Way Communication: Smart doorbells enable two-way audio communication, allowing you to speak with visitors remotely. This can be particularly useful for screening unwanted guests or giving instructions to delivery personnel.\n",
      "Motion Detection: Many smart doorbells come equipped with motion sensors that can detect movement in the vicinity of your door. When motion is detected, you’ll receive an alert on your smartphone, allowing you to take appropriate action if necessary.\n",
      "Video Recording: Smart doorbells typically record video footage of activity at your doorstep, which can be invaluable in the event of a security incident. This footage can be stored locally or in the cloud for later review.\n",
      "Drawbacks of Smart Doorbells\n",
      "Dependency on Wi-Fi: Smart doorbells rely on a stable Wi-Fi connection to function properly. If your Wi-Fi goes down, you may lose access to the doorbell’s features, compromising your home security.\n",
      "Potential Privacy Concerns: Some users have raised concerns about the privacy implications of smart doorbells, particularly regarding the storage and use of video footage. It’s important to choose a reputable brand with robust privacy policies.\n",
      "Subscription Fees: Some smart doorbell providers charge subscription fees for access to advanced features like cloud storage and video recording. Be sure to factor these costs into your budget when considering a smart doorbell.\n",
      "Smart Locks\n",
      "Smart locks offer a keyless entry solution that enhances both security and convenience. These devices replace traditional door locks with electronic mechanisms that can be controlled via smartphone, keypad, or biometric authentication.\n",
      "Benefits of Smart Locks\n",
      "Keyless Entry: With a smart lock, you can say goodbye to fumbling with keys. Simply use your smartphone, keypad, or fingerprint to unlock your door, streamlining the entry process.\n",
      "Remote Access Control: Smart locks allow you to grant access to your home remotely, making it easy to let in guests, family members, or service providers when you’re not there. You can also revoke access privileges at any time for added security.\n",
      "Activity Monitoring: Many smart locks track door activity, providing you with a log of who enters and exits your home. This can be useful for monitoring family members or keeping tabs on service personnel.\n",
      "Customizable Access Codes: Smart locks enable you to create unique access codes for different users, allowing you to control who has access to your home and when.\n",
      "Drawbacks of Smart Locks\n",
      "Power Dependency: Smart locks rely on batteries or electrical power to function. If the power goes out or the batteries die, you may be locked out of your home.\n",
      "Potential Vulnerabilities: Like any electronic device, smart locks are susceptible to hacking and security vulnerabilities. It’s important to choose a smart lock from a reputable brand with robust security features.\n",
      "Complexity: Smart locks can be more complex to install and configure than traditional door locks. Be sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions carefully or hire a professional installer.\n",
      "Wireless Security Cameras\n",
      "Wireless security cameras provide a flexible and convenient way to monitor your home, both indoors and outdoors. These cameras transmit video footage wirelessly to a central monitoring station or your smartphone, allowing you to keep an eye on your property from anywhere.\n",
      "Benefits of Wireless Security Cameras\n",
      "Remote Viewing: With a wireless security camera, you can view live video footage of your home from anywhere using your smartphone or tablet. This allows you to check in on your property while you’re away, providing added peace of mind.\n",
      "Easy Installation: Wireless security cameras are typically easier to install than wired cameras, as they don’t require running cables through walls or ceilings. Simply mount the camera in your desired location and connect it to your Wi-Fi network.\n",
      "Motion Detection: Many wireless security cameras come equipped with motion sensors that can detect movement in the camera’s field of view. When motion is detected, you’ll receive an alert on your smartphone, allowing you to investigate the situation.\n",
      "Night Vision: Wireless security cameras with night vision capabilities can capture clear footage even in low-light conditions, ensuring that you can monitor your property around the clock.\n",
      "Drawbacks of Wireless Security Cameras\n",
      "Wi-Fi Dependency: Wireless security cameras rely on a stable Wi-Fi connection to transmit video footage. If your Wi-Fi goes down, you may lose access to the camera’s feed, compromising your home security.\n",
      "Battery Life: Some wireless security cameras are battery-powered, which means you’ll need to replace or recharge the batteries periodically. Be sure to choose a camera with long battery life or consider a wired option.\n",
      "Potential Security Risks: Like any connected device, wireless security cameras are susceptible to hacking and security vulnerabilities. It’s important to choose a camera from a reputable brand with robust security features.\n",
      "Motion Sensors\n",
      "Motion sensors are an essential component of any home security system. These devices detect movement within a designated area and trigger an alarm or notification to alert you to potential intruders.\n",
      "Benefits of Motion Sensors\n",
      "Early Detection: Motion sensors provide early detection of potential intruders, giving you valuable time to respond to a security threat. By detecting movement before an intruder enters your home, you can take steps to protect yourself and your property.\n",
      "Wide Coverage: Motion sensors can cover a wide area, making them suitable for monitoring large rooms, hallways, or outdoor spaces. This ensures comprehensive coverage of your property.\n",
      "Customizable Sensitivity: Motion sensors typically offer adjustable sensitivity settings, allowing you to fine-tune the device to minimize false alarms. This ensures that you’re only alerted to genuine security threats.\n",
      "Integration with Smart Home Systems: Many motion sensors can be integrated with smart home systems, allowing you to automate security tasks like turning on lights or sounding an alarm when motion is detected.\n",
      "Drawbacks of Motion Sensors\n",
      "False Alarms: Motion sensors are prone to false alarms caused by pets, insects, or environmental factors like wind and rain. This can be frustrating and may desensitize you to genuine security threats.\n",
      "Limited Range: Motion sensors have a limited detection range, which means you may need to install multiple sensors to cover your entire property. Be sure to consider the sensor’s range when planning your home security setup.\n",
      "Vulnerability to Tampering: Motion sensors can be vulnerable to tampering by intruders who know how to disable or circumvent them. Consider placing sensors in discreet locations and using tamper-resistant models to minimize this risk.\n",
      "Alarm Systems\n",
      "Alarm systems provide a comprehensive security solution for protecting your home and family. These systems typically include a control panel, door and window sensors, motion detectors, and a siren to alert you and your neighbors to potential threats.\n",
      "Benefits of Alarm Systems\n",
      "Comprehensive Security: Alarm systems offer comprehensive security coverage of your home, protecting against a wide range of threats including burglary, fire, and carbon monoxide poisoning.\n",
      "24/7 Monitoring: Many alarm systems offer 24/7 professional monitoring, ensuring that help is always available in the event of an emergency. This provides added peace of mind, particularly when you’re away from home.\n",
      "Rapid Response: Alarm systems can trigger a rapid response from law enforcement or emergency services, minimizing the damage caused by a security incident. This can be crucial in protecting your property and loved ones.\n",
      "Deterrence: The presence of an alarm system can deter potential intruders, making your home less attractive as a target. This is particularly true for homes with visible alarm system components like window stickers and yard signs.\n",
      "Drawbacks of Alarm Systems\n",
      "Cost: Alarm systems can be expensive to purchase and install, particularly if you opt for a professional monitoring service. Be sure to factor these costs into your budget when considering an alarm system.\n",
      "False Alarms: Alarm systems are prone to false alarms caused by user error, equipment malfunctions, or environmental factors. This can be disruptive and may result in fines from local authorities.\n",
      "Complexity: Alarm systems can be complex to operate, particularly if you’re not familiar with security technology. Be sure to choose a system that is easy to use and provides clear instructions.\n",
      "Smart Lighting\n",
      "Smart lighting systems allow you to control your home’s lights remotely using your smartphone or tablet. These systems can be programmed to turn lights on and off automatically, creating the illusion that someone is home even when you’re away.\n",
      "Benefits of Smart Lighting\n",
      "Deterrence: Smart lighting can deter potential intruders by creating the illusion that someone is home. This can be particularly effective when combined with other security measures like alarm systems and security cameras.\n",
      "Remote Control: With a smart lighting system, you can control your home’s lights from anywhere using your smartphone or tablet. This allows you to turn lights on and off while you’re away, enhancing security and convenience.\n",
      "Energy Savings: Smart lighting systems can help you save energy by allowing you to schedule lights to turn on and off automatically. This can reduce your electricity bill and lower your carbon footprint.\n",
      "Customization: Smart lighting systems offer a high degree of customization, allowing you to create lighting scenes and schedules that suit your lifestyle. This can enhance both security and ambiance in your home.\n",
      "Drawbacks of Smart Lighting\n",
      "Dependency on Wi-Fi: Smart lighting systems rely on a stable Wi-Fi connection to function properly. If your Wi-Fi goes down, you may lose access to the system’s features, compromising your home security.\n",
      "Complexity: Smart lighting systems can be complex to set up and configure, particularly if you’re not familiar with smart home technology. Be sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions carefully or hire a professional installer.\n",
      "Compatibility Issues: Smart lighting systems may not be compatible with all types of light fixtures or bulbs. Be sure to check compatibility before investing in a smart lighting system.\n",
      "Smoke Detectors\n",
      "Smoke detectors are essential safety devices that alert you to the presence of smoke in your home. These detectors can save lives by providing early warning of a fire, giving you time to evacuate and call for help.\n",
      "Benefits of Smoke Detectors\n",
      "Early Warning: Smoke detectors provide early warning of a fire, giving you valuable time to evacuate your home and call for help. This can be crucial in preventing serious injuries or fatalities.\n",

      "What is a Nightstick?\n",
      "A nightstick, also known as a baton, is a defensive tool used for personal protection. It is a non-lethal weapon designed to deter threats, control situations, and, if necessary, subdue an attacker with focused strikes.\n",
      "Why Carry a Nightstick for Personal Protection?\n",
      "Increased Reach and Control: A nightstick extends your reach, allowing you to maintain a safer distance from a potential threat. This is particularly useful in crowded environments or when dealing with aggressive individuals.\n",
      "Psychological Deterrent: The mere presence of a nightstick can often deter potential attackers. It signals that you are prepared to defend yourself, which can make them reconsider their actions.\n",
      "Enhanced Self-Defense Capabilities: When used correctly, a nightstick can significantly enhance your self-defense capabilities. It allows you to deliver focused strikes to vulnerable areas, temporarily incapacitating an attacker and giving you time to escape or call for help.\n",
      "Understanding Nightstick Laws and Regulations\n",
      "Before carrying a nightstick, it’s essential to understand the laws and regulations in your area. Nightstick laws vary widely from state to state and even city to city. Some jurisdictions may require a permit to carry a nightstick, while others may have restrictions on the types of nightsticks that are allowed.\n",

Some jurisdictions may require a permit to carry a nightstick, while others may have restrictions on the types of nightsticks that are allowed.\n",
      "Common Types of Nightsticks\n",
      "Fixed-Length Batons\n",
      "Fixed-length batons are traditional nightsticks made from a single piece of material, typically wood or polymer. They are known for their durability and reliability, making them a popular choice for law enforcement and security personnel.\n",
      "Expandable Batons\n",
      "Expandable batons, also known as telescopic batons, are compact and easy to carry, but can be quickly extended to provide additional reach and striking power. They are typically made from steel or aluminum and feature a locking mechanism to keep them extended during use.\n",
      "Side-Handle Batons\n",
      "Side-handle batons, also known as T-batons, feature a perpendicular handle that provides a more secure grip and allows for a wider range of striking and defensive techniques. They are often used by law enforcement for riot control and close-quarters combat.\n",
      "How to Choose the Right Nightstick\n",
      "Material\n",
      "The material of a nightstick affects its weight, durability, and striking power. Common materials include:\n",
      "Wood: Traditional wood nightsticks are durable and have a natural feel, but can be susceptible to moisture and damage.\n",
      "Polymer: Polymer nightsticks are lightweight, weather-resistant, and offer good impact resistance.\n",
      "Steel: Steel nightsticks are extremely durable and offer maximum striking power, but can be heavy and difficult to carry.\n",
      "Aluminum: Aluminum nightsticks are lightweight and corrosion-resistant, but may not be as durable as steel or polymer.\n",
      "Length\n",
      "The length of a nightstick affects its reach and maneuverability. Longer nightsticks provide greater reach but can be more difficult to wield in close quarters. Shorter nightsticks are easier to maneuver but offer less reach. Consider your typical operating environment and the types of threats you are likely to encounter when choosing the right length.\n",
      "Weight\n",
      "The weight of a nightstick affects its striking power and ease of use. Heavier nightsticks deliver more forceful strikes, but can be tiring to carry and wield for extended periods. Lighter nightsticks are easier to carry and maneuver, but may not offer as much striking power. Choose a weight that you can comfortably handle and control.\n",
      "Grip\n",
      "The grip of a nightstick affects your control and comfort. Look for a nightstick with a textured or ergonomic grip that provides a secure hold, even in wet or slippery conditions. Some nightsticks also feature a lanyard or wrist strap to prevent them from being dropped during use.\n",
      "Portability\n",
      "Consider how you will carry the nightstick.\n",

      "The Importance of Work-Life BalanceWork-life balance is essential for police officers to maintain their well-being and avoid burnout. Balancing work and personal life can be challenging, especially in a high-pressure environment like law enforcement. It can be easy to get caught up in the demands of the job, but it’s crucial to make time for personal life activities.\n",
      "Police officers who have a healthy work-life balance tend to be more productive, efficient, and resilient in their jobs. They have more energy, focus, and motivation to perform their duties and respond to emergencies. Moreover, they can maintain good relationships with their family, friends, and community, which can ultimately contribute to their mental and emotional health.\n",

These areas have been subjects of legislative action in recent years in many states, so it is plausible that Virginia has also addressed them.

      "RepublicanViews.orgThe issue of how to address crime-how to fight crime, how to best capture and treat criminals, and how to actively prevent future crime-has been one of high contention for decades, and with good reason. The United States has one of the highest per-capita incarceration rates in the world, which puts it at over six times higher than the average of other industrialized nations, with one out of every hundred American adults in prison or jail. Including those on probation or parole, almost 1 in 33 adults is under some type of enforcement by the criminal-justice system. These sort of numbers don’t come cheap. The United States spends more than $80 billion per year on corrections at the federal, state, and local levels. This number has increased by over 4 times over the past 20 years. Senator Paul has stated, “If we’re for families with a mother and father around, we need to be for fixing the criminal-justice system.”\n",
      "Debates on this topic have ranged from prison reform goals to the death penalty, and many topics in between. While there are many views that span a wide horizon, they are more or less broken down into 2 overall principles that fall within party lines. Republican views on crime tend to be much stricter than Democratic views. Republicans believe in more stringent sentencing laws for felons, supports a database for convicted child murderers, supports courts having the right to use the death penalty, and believes in stronger victim rights and harsher punishments for certain, especially heinous crimes. They view stricter punishment as a deterrent to future crime, and believe this is the best way to address crime and criminals in today’s society. They also wish to see prisons reformed in ways that reflect this idea. They oppose reforms proposed by the Democratic Party that would see better higher education options and more comfortable accommodations in prisons.\n",

      "            \"text\": \"(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});  The issue of how to address crime-how to fight crime, how to best capture and treat criminals, and how to actively prevent future crime-has been one of high contention for decades, and with good reason. The United States has one of the highest per-capita incarceration rates in the world, which puts it at over six times higher than the average of other industrialized nations, with one out of every hundred American adults in prison or jail. Including those on probation or parole, almost 1 in 33 adults is under some type of enforcement by the criminal-justice system. These sort of numbers don\\u2019t come cheap. The United States spends more than $80 billion per year on corrections at the federal, state, and local levels. This number has increased by over 4 times over the past 20 years. Senator Paul has stated, \\u201cIf we\\u2019re for families with a mother and father around, we need to be for fixing the criminal-justice system.\\u201d Debates on this topic have ranged from prison reform goals to the death penalty, and many topics in between. While there are many views that span a wide horizon, they are more or less broken down into 2 overall principles that fall within party lines. Republican views on crime tend to be much stricter than Democratic views. Republicans believe in more stringent sentencing laws for felons, supports a database for convicted child murderers, supports courts having the right to use the death penalty, and believes in stronger victim rights and harsher punishments for certain, especially heinous crimes. They view stricter punishment as a deterrent to future crime, and believe this is the best way to address crime and criminals in today\\u2019s society. They also wish to see prisons reformed in ways that reflect this idea. They oppose reforms proposed by the Democratic Party that would see better higher education options and more comfortable accommodations in prisons.  Republicans On Stricter Sentencing First and foremost, Republicans have traditionally supported stricter sentencing for major crimes. They believe that there are some crimes for which criminals should simply not be eligible for parole, and for which the death penalty should be an option to the court. These issues have long been items of party contention. The 2012 Republican Party Platform stated, \\u201cLiberals do not understand this simple axiom: criminals behind bars cannot harm the general public. To that end, we support mandatory prison sentencing for gang crimes, violent or sexual offenses against children, repeat drug dealers, rape, robbery and murder. We support a national registry for convicted child murderers. We oppose parole for dangerous or repeat felons. Courts should have the option of imposing the death penalty in capital murder cases.\\u201d Furthermore, Republicans believe that there should be \\u201cno-frills prisons that make the threat of jail a deterrent to crime\\u2026and a Constitutional amendment to protect victims\\u2019 rights.\\u201d This is not to say that Republicans believe all offenders should go to prison and stay there without question. They support an effective program of rehabilitation, when it is appropriate, and also support of community-based diversion programs for first time, non-violent offenders. However, for violent or repeat crimes, they have generally wished to see strict enforcement and harsh penalties. While these are the beliefs that have been long-held by the Republican Party, there has been a shift in these stances between the 2012 and 2016 elections. Prison reform and better treatment for prisoners are hot-button issues among millennials \\u2013 who are the biggest up and coming voting demographic. For this reason, many candidates have been rethinking their stances and supporting laws that would reduce prison time, allow some felons to expunge or seal their criminal records, and even reform federal drug laws. Republicans such as Ted Cruz, Rick Perry, Chris Christie, and Jeb Bush have all spoken out in support of this new Party direction concerning crime. However, this trend is not party-wide, and seems to have been making some internal waves. Some, such as Marco Rubio and Scott Walker, are sticking to the traditional party values, and still wish to see stricter imprisonment laws and harsher sentencing for violent crimes. Republicans On The Death Penalty Republicans support the death penalty. Much of this support is to help victims of violent crimes. In the 2004 Republican Party Platform, Republicans stated, \\u201cThe Republican Party and President Bush support a federal Constitutional amendment for victims of violent crime that would provide specific rights for victims protected under the U.S. Constitution. We support courts having the option to impose the death penalty in capital murder cases.\\u201d They also believe that the death penalty deters future crimes, stating \\u201cWe agree that the best way to deter crime is to enforce existing laws and hand down tough penalties against anyone who commits a crime with a gun.\\u201d While many Democrats oppose the death penalty because they don\\u2019t believe that it helps prevent crimes, Republicans argue that stricter punishments are, indeed, a deterrent. They prove this by stating \\u201cSince Project Safe Neighborhoods was instituted in 2001, hundreds of new federal, state, and local prosecutors have been hired to target criminals who use guns. Prosecutions are up 68 percent, and the violent crime victimization rate is down 21 percent.\\u201d          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});   Rand Paul On Crime Rand Paul is the Republican candidate most identified with calls for criminal-justice reform so far. He recently joined Democratic Senators Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand in sponsoring legislation that would repeal the federal ban on marijuana and co-sponsored the REDEEM (Record Expungement Designed to Enhance Employment) Act with Booker. This act would make it easier to expunge or seal criminal records for nonviolent offenses, under the premise that an arrest for youthful infringements such as marijuana possession or joy-riding should not become a permanent barrier to getting a job. Ted Cruz On Crime Senator Ted Cruz is another Republican who has come to support prison and criminal justice system reform. He recently joined Democratic Senators Richard Durbin, Patrick Leahy, and Cory Booker in introducing legislation that would significantly reduce sentences for many federal drug crimes that passed the Judiciary Committee in 2014 by a vote of 12 to 5. Cruz also co-sponsored legislation with Senator Paul to make the reduction in crack sentencing approved by Congress in 2010 retroactive, and supported cutting the mandatory minimum sentence for a variety of drug offenses by 50 percent. Chris Christie On Crime Governor Chris Christie has been another proponent of reform, though his efforts have not been as extreme as those of Paul and Cruz. Christie has called for treatment rather than jail time for most nonviolent drug offenses. He has stated,\\u201cWe will end the failed war on drugs that believes that incarceration is the cure of every ill caused by drug abuse.\\u201d Christie has also pushed for bail reform, stating that these efforts are \\u201cgiving nonviolent offenders who often sit in jail because they can\\u2019t afford bail a chance to reclaim their lives.\\u201d Jeb Bush On Crime Jeb Bush has also begun to support the reform of the criminal justice system. Bush, who once called for building more prisons and emphasized \\u201cpunishment over therapy\\u201d for juvenile offenders, now warns that incarceration can turn low-level lawbreakers into hardened career criminals. Bush has also signed onto the Right on Crime initiative, along with Perry. Scott Walker On Crime Scott Walker is among the Republicans who still support stricter punishment for crime. Walker ran for governor of Wisconsin as an old-fashioned \\u201claw and order\\u201d Republican, pledging \\u201cto protect our families, our senior citizens and our property.\\u201d Walker sponsored bills supporting increased mandatory minimum sentences for everything from perjury to privacy invasion to intoxicated boating. He was one of the leading supporters of Wisconsin\\u2019s \\u201cTruth in Sentencing\\u201d legislation, which ended parole opportunities and increased prison time for many categories of prisoners. As governor, Walker has resisted efforts to liberalize the state\\u2019s parole system. The proportion of inmates granted parole has fallen by 50 percent during his time in office. Marco Rubio On Crime Senator Marco Rubio also seems to be sticking to the traditionally strict views on criminal-justice issues. \\u201cWhile individuals from a variety of perspectives have made a compelling case that American law has been over-criminalized and over-federalized, reform should not begin with careless weakening of drug laws that have done so much to help end the violence and mayhem that plagued American cities in prior decades.\\u201d Rubio stated in an op-ed. Republicans On Prison Reform With greater Republican support for reform, President Obama and Democrats are pushing ahead for prison reform. Lawmakers for this reform include representatives from both parties, as well as conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch, showing a great compromise on these issues. Obama plans to meet with prison officials and inmates inside a federal penitentiary in El Reno, Oklahoma, in order to \\u201cunderscore the administration\\u2019s focus on the need to reform and improve America\\u2019s criminal justice system,\\u201d said White House press secretary Josh Earnest. In March of 2015, Obama shortened the sentences of nearly two dozen drug inmates, including eight who were facing life imprisonment. \\u201cWith prisons overcrowded by almost 40 percent, and more people behind bars \\u2014 2.3 million \\u2014 than in any other country in the world, sentencing reform simply makes good fiscal and humanitarian sense,\\u201d said Mike Riggs of Families Against Mandatory Minimums. \\u201cThe Bureau of Prisons is spending 25 percent of the DOJ budget \\u2014 much of it on nonviolent drug offenders,\\u201d Riggs said. \\u201cDo we really need to do that, when we\\u2019re trying to fight cyberterrorism and ISIS?\\u201d Veteran defense lawyer George Goltzer also believes in the benefits of sentencing reform. \\u201cWe deal with these guidelines every day, and the catalog of human tragedy is amazing. These are not major drug dealers; these are not the leaders of a cartel,\\u201d said Goltzer.

      "3.  **Bias-Free Policing:** Laws addressing racial profiling or biased policing necessitate changes in training, data collection, and reporting procedures to ensure equitable enforcement.\n",
      "4.  **Mental Health Response:** Legislation focused on mental health crises often leads to protocols for crisis intervention teams, training in de-escalation for individuals with mental illness, and partnerships with mental health providers.\n",
      "5.  **Search and Seizure:** Changes to laws governing search and seizure require updates to protocols related to warrants, probable cause, and consent searches.\n",

      "It’s easy to feel a little bit panicky as you hand your kid a phone or tablet. On the one hand, technology offers them so many ways to connect, create, and learn. On the other hand, it opens them up to scams, exploitation, bullying, and a whole host of other digital dangers.\n",
      "So how do you navigate this? What’s the right way to talk to kids about online safety, at every age? Here’s a break-down, from the preschool years to teenhood:\n",
      "Preschoolers\n",
      "What to teach them:\n",
      "If your preschooler is using a device, it should be for a limited amount of time and always with you nearby. But even at this age, you can begin instilling some basic principles:\n",
      "What they should do:\n",
      "Never give out their name, address, or any other personal information.\n",
      "Never click on pop-up ads.\n",
      "What you should do:\n",
      "Set up parental controls on every device they use.\n",
      "Download age-appropriate apps and games. Common Sense Media is a great resource for finding out what’s safe and fun for kids.\n",
      "Grade Schoolers\n",
      "What to teach them:\n",
      "Once kids start school, they can grasp more complex online safety concepts. Reinforce the lessons above, and add these:\n",
      "What they should do:\n",
      "Don’t talk to strangers online. Explain that people aren’t always who they say they are.\n",
      "If anything makes them feel uncomfortable, they should tell you.\n",
      "Keep their passwords private.\n",
      "What you should do:\n",
      "Check in with them regularly about what they’re doing online.\n",
      "Set time limits for devices.\n",
      "Tweens\n",
      "What to teach them:\n",
      "The tween years are a time of huge growth, and they’re also when kids start to crave more independence. As they navigate social media and other online platforms, discuss these issues with them:\n",
      "What they should do:\n",
      "Think before they post. What seems funny to them might be hurtful to someone else.\n",
      "Never share anything online that they wouldn’t want their family members to see.\n",
      "What you should do:\n",
      "Give them more privacy, but stay involved. Check their social media accounts periodically.\n",
      "Teach them how to block or report someone who’s harassing them.\n",
      "Make sure they know they can come to you with any problems or concerns.\n",
      "Teens\n",
      "What to teach them:\n",
      "By the time they’re teens, kids are pretty tech-savvy. Still, they need guidance on some important topics:\n",
      "What they should do:\n",
      "Be careful about what they share online. Explain that colleges and future employers might look at their social media accounts.\n",
      "Respect other people’s privacy. Don’t share their photos or personal information without permission.\n",
      "What you should do:\n",
      "Trust them, but verify. They need more independence than ever, but it’s still smart to keep an eye on their online activities.\n",
      "Explain the dangers of online predators. Even smart, savvy teens can be vulnerable to scams or exploitation.\n",
      "The bottom line:\n",
      "The internet can be a wonderful resource for kids, but it’s important to teach them how to use it safely. By talking to them about online safety at every age, you can help them navigate the digital world with confidence.\n",

As a parent, you want to make sure your child learns how to use technology in a safe and responsible way. With some planning and guidance, you can introduce your child to the digital world and set them up for success. Here are some tips for bringing your child into the world of tech in a healthy way.\n",
      "Start with Age-Appropriate Devices\n",
      "When first introducing technology to your child, choose age-appropriate devices and apps. For young children, basic feature phones, learning tablets like LeapFrog or Amazon Fire Kids Edition, and smart toys can allow interactive play while limiting access to the wider internet. For older children, consider starter smartphones that allow calling and texting or tablets with parental controls activated. Apps like YouTube Kids provide engaging content while filtering out inappropriate videos.\n",
      "Set Time Limits\n",
      "It’s important to set reasonable time limits for technology use from the start. For young children, aim for no more than an hour of screen time per day focused on educational activities. For older kids, two hours of recreational screen time per day is often the recommended limit. When their time is up, have them switch gears to non-tech activities. Setting expectations early prevents battles over screen time later.\n",

      "Set House Rules\n",
      "Have clear rules in place regarding when and where devices can be used such as no phones at the dinner table or after a set bedtime. Discuss online etiquette and make sure children understand how to interact kindly with others in digital spaces. Outline consequences for breaking rules like losing technology privileges. Setting expectations for responsible use early on develops good habits.\n",
      "Use Parental Controls\n",
      "Take advantage of parental control options to manage and monitor your child’s technology use. Most devices have built-in tools that allow you to restrict access, limit screen time, and filter content. Enabling restrictions helps ensure your child’s internet use is safe and appropriate. Here are the best \n",
      "parental control apps according to cybersecurity experts Cybernews.\n",
      "Role Model Responsible Use\n",
      "Lead by example when it comes to digital responsibility. Model good habits like putting away your phone during family time and not texting while driving. Consider having times when the whole family unplugs from devices together. Talk about using tech moderately and demonstrate balancing screen time with other activities. Your example provides a powerful guide for your child to follow.\n",

      "What to know:\n",
      "💙 Staying calm under pressure helps you think clearly, make better decisions, and respond rather than react. You can hone this skill by practicing mindfulness, even just for a few minutes a day.\n",
      "💙 Mindfulness interrupts anxious thought loops by grounding your attention in the present.\n",
      "💙 Simple mindful habits like deep breathing, single-tasking, journaling, movement, and getting quality sleep can help you form a steady foundation for handling stress more effectively.\n",

      "We’ve all had those days where we feel cool as a cucumber no matter what life throws at us. And we’ve all had those days where the littlest pebble of a problem feels like a boulder that’s poised to push us into a full-blown meltdown.\n",
      "Learning how to stay calm when you’re under pressure isn’t always easy, but it’s a great skill to cultivate.

      "Staying calm \n",
      "under pressure is not just a handy skill, it's a life-enhancer. It means not losing it when the kids are having a meltdown, the bills are piling up, or when things don't go according to plan. It’s maintaining your composure during challenging meetings, tight deadlines, or when dealing with difficult customers or colleagues. \n",
      "Remaining level-headed under pressure doesn't mean you do not take things seriously or care. Quite the opposite! It means you can think clearly, analyze situations objectively, and make the best possible decisions. It's about responding rather than reacting, being proactive instead of reactive. It's a sign of strength, resilience, and emotional intelligence. And it's a skill you can develop. So how do you do it?\n",

Taking the time to focus on each part of my body helped me release tension and become more aware of how I hold stress physically. The biggest barrier I faced was staying patient and not rushing through the exercise, as my mind kept wandering to other tasks. To combat this, I practiced gentle reminders to myself to return to the present moment, which gradually made the process more seamless and beneficial. Reply\"\n",

      "In the 21st century, law enforcement is no longer limited to radios, handcuffs, and patrol cars. The rise of police technology has transformed how officers detect, deter, and respond to crime. From body-worn cameras to AI-powered crime prediction, today’s tech-enabled policing tools offer unprecedented efficiency—but also raise complex ethical concerns.\n",
      "This article explores the most impactful tools, the cutting-edge trends, and the ethical challenges shaping the future of law enforcement.\n",
      "What Is Police Technology?\n",
      "Police technology refers to the range of tools, software, and systems used by law enforcement agencies to enhance public safety, streamline operations, and improve decision-making. These technologies aim to make policing more efficient, transparent, and proactive.\n",

      "Body-Worn Cameras (BWCs) \n",
      "Widely adopted across the U.S. and beyond, BWCs are designed to increase accountability and transparency. They provide video evidence of interactions, helping resolve disputes and support investigations.\n",
      "According to the \n",
      "National Institute of Justice, BWCs can reduce use-of-force incidents and improve evidence collection when activated properly.\n",
      "Facial Recognition Software\n",
      "Used to identify suspects in real time or from security footage, this tool can speed up investigations—but has been criticized for racial bias and inaccuracy.\n",
      "Drones (UAVs) \n",
      "Drones offer a bird’s-eye view during crowd monitoring, search-and-rescue missions, or high-risk operations. They’re increasingly used in urban areas to track activity in real time.\n",

      "Robotics \n",
      "Robots are deployed in high-risk situations, such as bomb disposal or hostage rescues, reducing the danger to human officers.\n",
      "Ethical Challenges in Police Technology\n",
      "As police departments adopt more advanced tools, ethical concerns grow. One major issue is privacy—technologies like facial recognition and license plate readers can lead to over-surveillance and data collection without consent.\n",
      "Another concern is bias in algorithms. Predictive policing software often uses flawed historical data, which can unfairly target certain communities and reinforce existing inequalities.\n",
      "Transparency is also crucial. Body cameras and AI tools are only effective if departments use them consistently and allow public oversight. Without clear policies, these technologies risk doing more harm than good.\n",
      "Finally, public trust is essential. Community trust is vital—especially when new technologies are introduced without public input. A \n",
      "GovTech survey found that while people generally support transparency tools like body cameras, skepticism increases when surveillance is used without explanation or oversight. If people feel they’re being monitored instead of protected, trust in law enforcement can quickly erode.\n",

Algorithms decode patterns and crime trends, enabling law enforcement to anticipate and preempt criminal activities with precision. \n",
      "AI technology can rapidly analyze massive volumes of digital data, such as files, emails, and communications. This allows investigators to sort through large datasets efficiently and pinpoint critical evidence.\n",

Analysis may also involve comparing faces captured in surveillance footage or images obtained from social media profiles with known databases of individuals to establish their identity. \n",
      "The incorporation of technology has fundamentally transformed how law enforcement combats criminal activities. Artificial intelligence, predictive policing, social media forensics, and facial recognition are arming law enforcement with the tools they need to continue fighting crime in a digital era.

      "\n",
      "Law enforcement is increasingly relying on technology for crime prevention. The tools used range from \"hard technology\" like devices and equipment to \"soft technology\" like software and data analysis techniques. Key technologies include body-worn cameras (BWCs) for increased transparency, facial recognition software for identifying suspects, drones for surveillance, and license plate readers. Emerging trends involve the use of AI and machine learning to analyze policing data for predictive policing, real-time crime centers (RTCCs) that aggregate data from various sources, and virtual reality (VR) for training simulations. The use of social media forensics and digital forensic software are also highlighted. However, ethical concerns are present, including potential privacy violations, biases in algorithms, and the need for transparency and public trust to avoid erosion of faith in law enforcement. The integration of both hard and soft technologies are crucial for proactive and effective crime prevention in the digital age.\n",

SolarDecember 8, 2015When I started my career in law enforcement nearly 35 years ago, the only \"technology\" we needed was the police radio and the location of the nearest pay phone. Today police radios scan 30 channels and officers typically have in-car video cameras, traffic monitoring radar units, in-car computer data terminals with Internet access, body cameras, a department-issued cellphones and, of course, personal cellphones. With all this technology in the cruisers it’s a wonder we don't have more officer-involved crashes than we do.\n",

      "In an article titled \"How Technology is Changing Law Enforcement\" published on Police Magazine, Patrick J. Solar discusses how modern technology has become a double-edged sword for law enforcement. While tools like social media can aid in investigations, they also enable criminal coordination. The article highlights specific technologies impacting police work, including the Waze app, 3D crime scene imaging, through-the-wall radar, body-worn cameras, and predictive analytics software.\n",
      "\n",
      "The article emphasizes that despite the challenges posed by technology, law enforcement agencies are adapting by using innovative tools to serve their communities. Body-worn cameras provide first-hand accounts of incidents and training opportunities, while predictive analytics help identify criminal patterns. The author argues that with proper knowledge and tools, law enforcement can leverage the vast digital landscape to combat crime effectively.\n",

SolarDecember 8, 2015When I started my career in law enforcement nearly 35 years ago, the only \"technology\" we needed was the police radio and the location of the nearest pay phone. Today police radios scan 30 channels and officers typically have in-car video cameras, traffic monitoring radar units, in-car computer data terminals with Internet access, body cameras, a department-issued cellphones and, of course, personal cellphones. With all this technology in the cruisers it’s a wonder we don't have more officer-involved crashes than we do.\n",

      "When I started my career in law enforcement nearly 35 years ago, the only \"technology\" we needed was the police radio and the location of the nearest pay phone. Today police radios scan 30 channels and officers typically have in-car video cameras, traffic monitoring radar units, in-car computer data terminals with Internet access, body cameras, a department-issued cellphones and, of course, personal cellphones. With all this technology in the cruisers it’s a wonder we don't have more officer-involved crashes than we do.\n",
      "Advances in technology have been a mixed blessing for contemporary law enforcement agencies. Take the explosive spread of Internet access over the last two decades, for example. On one hand, everyday technologies like social media and other applications are a boon to law enforcement but they have also made it possible for gangs and even terrorist organizations to coordinate like never before, creating an entirely new digital space that needs policing.\n",
      "Social media is far from the only technology that’s drawn concern from police. Many in the law enforcement community have particularly cited a mobile app called \n",
      "Waze, a traffic-tracking tool that displays the current location of police officers, as potentially allowing those with criminal intent to avoid or seek out and harm law enforcement personnel.\n",
      "While this certainly complicates the work of keeping the public safe, criminals using the Internet, whatever they use it for, often leave a trail behind. With the proper knowledge and tools on their side, law enforcement technicians can use this expansive channel of communication against potential or suspected criminal offenders. The Internet has become a broad web of shared personal information that remains permissible as evidence when attained legally, creating an organic database of recorded behaviors that can provide unique insight into each case. When analyzed, this data can even be useful in identifying criminal patterns and anticipating threats.\n",

      "Technology is transforming law enforcement in both positive and negative ways. On the one hand, it equips officers with new tools to fight crime, such as body-worn cameras, advanced analytics, and improved communication systems. These technologies can enhance transparency, improve evidence collection, enable predictive policing, and facilitate better resource allocation. However, technology also presents challenges, such as privacy concerns, the potential for algorithmic bias, and the increased ability for criminals to coordinate and operate in the digital space. Law enforcement agencies need to adapt by embracing new technologies while also addressing the ethical and practical challenges they pose. Effective training, clear policies, and community engagement are essential to ensure that technology is used responsibly and effectively to serve and protect the public.\n",

Continued Republican calls for cuts of this magnitude—both secret proposals from Republican leadership and public demands from extremists in the party—would defund the police by eliminating local law enforcement positions and slashing crime prevention and justice grants to local and state governments. It would make our border less secure and make train and air travel more dangerous at a time when train derailments are wreaking havoc on communities across the country. These proposals are unrealistic, unsustainable, and unconscionable,\" Appropriations Committee Ranking Member DeLauro said.\"If the Republican plan to cut FY24 federal spending to FY22 levels applies to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), we would witness increased drug trafficking, criminal activity, cybersecurity threats, wait times at airports and other ports of entry, and reduced funding to help our communities prepare for disasters. Ultimately, cuts in funding will force DHS agencies like U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Secret Service, and the U.S. Coast Guard to stop hiring personnel and abandon critical initiatives that ensure our domestic security,\" said Homeland Security Subcommittee Ranking Member Henry Cuellar. \"As Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, I will continue to fight for robust funding for DHS. Our families, our economy, and our nation are depending on it.\"\"Americans are calling for increased rail safety inspections and more air traffic controllers to keep our skies and rail lines safe. Republican cuts will do the opposite. All of this is on top of putting hundreds of thousands of American families out on the street by cutting funding to housing. We need a federal budget that will prioritize enhanced safety and security for the American people. The Republican proposal is out of step with the needs of Americans,\" said Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Ranking Member Mike Quigley.\"Last year, as Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the Department of Justice, I included strong funding increases for more local police officers as well as more Federal law enforcement and prosecutors,\" said Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Ranking Member Matt Cartwright. \"However, the extreme budget cuts proposed this year by the Freedom Caucus would greatly damage these critical public safety and crime-fighting efforts. In addition to forcing the loss of hundreds of local police officers, such cuts would eliminate thousands of Federal prosecutors and FBI agents and analysts working to combat everything from gun violence to organized crime to domestic and international terrorism. The proposal would also gut efforts to address the opioid crisis, combat violence against women, and prevent juvenile delinquency. I will work tirelessly this year to help prevent such a damaging proposal from becoming law. We cannot reverse the progress we have made.\" NewsPress Releases\n",

      "Increase Public Safety\n",
      "Community outreach can also directly improve public safety. When police have strong relationships with community members, people are more likely to share information about crimes. This information can help police solve crimes more quickly and prevent future incidents.\n",

      "The best way to ensure that your outreach programs are relevant and effective is to get input from the community. What are their concerns? What kind of programs would they like to see? You can gather this information through surveys, focus groups, and town hall meetings.\n",
      "2. Partner With Community Organizations\n",
      "Partnering with community organizations can help you reach a wider audience and build trust. These organizations can provide valuable insights into the needs of the community and help you design programs that are culturally sensitive and relevant.\n",
      "3. Be Visible and Accessible\n",
      "Make sure that officers are visible and accessible during community outreach events. This means being approachable, friendly, and willing to answer questions. It also means being present in the community outside of organized events.\n",
      "4. Be Consistent\n",
      "Consistency is key to building trust. Make sure that your outreach programs are ongoing and sustainable. This shows the community that you are committed to building long-term relationships.\n",
      "5. Measure Your Results\n",
      "Finally, be sure to measure the results of your outreach programs. What impact are they having on relationships between police and the community? Are they improving public safety? Measuring your results will help you refine your programs and make them more effective.\n",

      "n the 1992 presidential campaign, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton each tried to prove he was toughest on crime. Bush touted a record of escalating the drug war during the Reagan years. Clinton famously flew to Arkansas to stage-manage the execution of a mentally disabled killer. Elections at the state level in that period followed the same pattern, with Republicans pushing for ever more severe criminal penalties and Democrats following them as fast as they could run.\n",
      "In the 2016 election, the storyline has been almost completely reversed. Hillary Clinton's first major policy speech focused on reducing unnecessary incarceration — and, despite attacking her on everything else, no Republican candidate has gone after her for being soft on crime. An electorally driven consensus in favor of ever-expanding punishment is being replaced by fairly broad elite agreement on the need to reduce our extraordinary levels of incarceration, make prison conditions more humane, and steer offenders back into productive lives.\n",
      "Liberals and conservatives have arrived at these conclusions from different principles. Liberals tend to view \"mass incarceration\" as a product of structural racism and crony capitalism, and emphasize the disadvantaged conditions of most offenders. Conservatives see the expansion of prisons as a case of big government run amok and stress the potential for offenders to be spiritually redeemed. These distinct narratives make prison reform a case of \"trans-partisanship\" — agreement on policy goals driven by divergent, deeply held ideological beliefs. This is very different from bipartisanship, in which established institutions facilitate compromise by bringing two sides together to split the difference with \"grand bargains\" brokered by party leaders. Trans-partisanship, by contrast, is typically led by ideological true-believers on the back benches, and distinct factions that converge on shared policy positions through separate, independent routes.\n",
      "Trans-partisan agreement on criminal justice was a long time in the making. It was driven by ideological diehards on both sides, who worked for years against near-hopeless odds before their labors bore fruit. On the right, the evangelical leader Charles Colson was arguing even at the height of the crime war that better prison conditions, less incarceration, and better re-entry services were genuinely conservative objectives. On the left, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Open Society Institute, and other organizations ensured that a commitment to lowering incarceration would remain embedded in the liberal identity, even as Democratic politicians tried their best to prove themselves \"tough on crime.\"\n",

After the George Floyd protests, many cities passed measures that restricted police power and made it more difficult for police officers to do their jobs. A study from the University of Pennsylvania, for example, found that civilian oversight boards reduce police activity and increase crime. These policies should be repealed.\n",
