Prompt 1: Who are key leaders (field grade officers and senior NCO’s) in charge of U.S. military units combating the ebola epidemic in Africa, what are the protocols for personnel safety, and what is their mission? Units from all four services were deployed to West Africa, some 3000 personnel in all, in support of U.S. and international aid workers. The military was not directly involved in treating ebola patients. Their mission was to provide support services such as facilities construction, logistics, telecommunications, road building, etc. so that the medical aid workers could function more effectively. Additionally, the research addressed safety protocols for the U.S. forces, including mandatory quarantines upon return to their home bases. Non relevant information encompasses non-U.S. military units and civilian aid workers and U.S. military units that did not deploy to Africa.

Prompt 2: Identify the conspiracies circulating about Ebola. Any information on conspiracy theories about Ebola is relevant. Degree of relevance was determined by the specificity of the information. A major grey area is the difference among a conspiracy (an even caused by powerful people or groups to benefit themselves), a myth (an idea or story believed by many people but is not true), a hoax (a trick, deception, or prank), and disinformation (intentionally false or inaccurate information spread deliberately). Information clearly related to a hoax is not relevant. There probably is more data available on this topic.

Specificity of the information, whether the treatment is a potential cure or a ""known"" cure, and whether the treatment is supportive versus a cure determined the judgments' degree of relevancy.

Prompt 7: How has the movement of people from outlying rural villages to urban centers affected the spread of Ebola? Since Ebola was first discovered in 1976, the population of the affected areas in Africa has almost tripled and the percentage of people living in cities has risen dramatically. The disease hasn't changed over time, but the demographics have. Up until this latest outbreak, the disease hit mainly in rural villages, where it was more easily stopped, but now it spreads much more rapidly making it harder to contain and treat. Beyond urbanization is migration, while the virus is oblivious to borders and boundaries.

Prompt 8: This research centered on Dr. Olivet Buck, a Sierra Leone doctor who died of ebola after contracting the disease from her patients. Dr. Buck was the fourth Sierra Leone doctor to become infected, and when she fell ill, there was official concern, both for her personally and for the potential depletion of the country’s medical personnel. The President of Sierra Leone formally asked the World Health Organization (WHO) to evacuate Dr. Buck to Germany for treatment. WHO refused, saying they did not have the resources to evacuate anyone but their own staff, and Dr. Buck died. Relevant information included the official involvement of the Government of Sierra Leone, WHO’s response, Dr. Buck’s biography, and identification of other medical fatalities in Sierra Leone. Non-relevant information included biographic details of Dr. Buck’s colleagues beyond their names, medical fatalities in other West Africa countries, and treatment of foreign aid workers.

Prompt 9: The research centered on Liberian national Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person to die of ebola in the U.S. Duncan flew to the U.S. to visit relatives in Dallas, fell ill, was initially misdiagnosed at a hospital emergency room and sent home. His condition worsened, he returned to the hospital and was correctly diagnosed, but died. Two nurses who treated him subsequently contracted ebola; both recovered. Duncan’s family threatened to sue the hospital but reached a financial settlement out of court. Relevant information encompassed the postmortem repercussions, potential spread of the disease via primary and secondary contacts, Duncan's biographical information, and status of the two infected nurses. Non-relevant information included persons and activities not connected to the Duncan case, including other infected U.S. medical personnel and other fatalities in the U.S. and West Africa.

Prompt 18: What roles can robots and software play in the diagnosis and treatment of Ebola? Given that health care workers are at the highest risk of contracting Ebola while treating infected patients, what software, electronic, and mechanical devices are currently available and can be developed and used in the field. The goal is to make diagnosis and treatment as ""hands off"" as possible, to mitigate the risk as much as possible. A number of viable robots already exist, and are used for various purposes, including disinfecting, decontaminating, handling waste, consulting between patients and doctors around the world. Government, private industry, and robotics scientists across the country are working together to adapt and implement these technologies to work in the field of medicine and the challenging conditions in West Africa.

Prompt 19: Find mentions of attacks on people, vehicles or facilities in Africa that provide education or medical aid regarding ebola. A general statement concerning attacks is relevant.

Prompt 30: Where are basal boundary conditions in East Antarctica? This was both a poorly formulated topic and suffered for lack of advanced search features: "East Antarctica" was not seen by the search as a unit and therefore many results were presented for east-other0location and N/W/S-antarctica Baring a survey answering the exact topic question, the only what to deduce and answer was to find studies of basal boundaries within east antarctica and from that infer there location of various instances. Finally, in response to these challenges, with minimal results to present I presume, the results provided were a flood of completely unrelated documents that it became impossible to sort through.

Prompt 31: How will changes in sea-level rise affect storm surges? What causes sea level rise? Which part of the world is the most vulnerable to storm surge caused by sea level rise? What is the change of the sea level rise? What is the relationship between sea level rise and storm surge? Not much data about storm surge. More information about the recent trend of sea level rise.

What kind of dataset is useful to analyze the rate of snow accumulation in Greenland? Is the rate of snow accumulation changing? What modulates the rate of snow accumulation in Greenland?

Prompt 36: Is the rate of snow accumulation changing in Antarctica? There was greater document duplication than any other topic which seriously hampered efforts - given finite human time duplicates should have been removed prior to this stage of the study. The search resulted in many links from a single blog which, while itself reporting on the practicalities of a highly relevant study, did not actually report any of the results and any publications from such were never provided. Instead a myriad of co-blogs and news reports on the same study appeared which provided no useful information More than in any other topics there were multiple website who's colour theme rendered them illegible In terms of the ML learning what type of document or word selection was most desirable, it was unfortunate that tagging links to highly relevnat studies did not result in those studies being provided for further analysis
