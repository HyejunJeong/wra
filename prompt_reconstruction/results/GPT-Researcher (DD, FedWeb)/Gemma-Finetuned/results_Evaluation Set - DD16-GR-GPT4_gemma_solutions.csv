Of interest is who she knows, where she lives, where she works, what her profession is, and who her family is. Mention of her tangentially in articles about other Ebola cases is not relevant. A comedian's jokes about her are not relevant. A caption identifying her from """"a Cafferkey family photo"""" is not relevant. Relevancy was judged based on the specificity of the information. In the Contacts sub-topic, relevancy also was based on the likelihood that the individual knew Cafferkey directly.
