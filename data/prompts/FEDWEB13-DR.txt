- Operating System: Unless otherwise specified, cover both Windows and Mac if there are meaningful differences.
- Delimiter: Since I don’t know the delimiter character in the .csv, include instructions on what to do if my data does not display correctly on first import.
- Language: No language preference is specified; respond in English.

**Formatting Requirements:**

- Use clear section headers as outlined above.
- Include a resource summary table as requested.
- Where possible, link directly to primary sources (e.g., Microsoft official documentation, Microsoft’s YouTube channel).
- Use lists, bullet points, and visual formatting for clarity.

**Additional Notes:**

- Do not assume familiarity with Excel’s data import wizards or relevant menus. Include explanations of terminology if needed.
- If possible, mention the difference between opening CSV files by double-clicking, using “Open with Excel,” and using Excel’s “Import” functions (and the pros/cons of each method).
- If available, suggest video walkthroughs with timestamps or table-of-contents for ease of access.

**Summary Table Example:**

Instructions for Researcher

Objective:  
I want to obtain the latest AVG home edition antivirus tool. My priority is to find the most recent and official version, preferably for home (not business) use. Recency is my main concern: any AVG version released before 2013 is non-relevant. The official AVG homepage is the most relevant source. Pages offering only the free version are still of interest, but less so than those providing the full home edition.

Guidelines:

1. **Source Prioritization**
    - Start by searching the official AVG homepage (https://www.avg.com), as it is the primary and most credible source.
    - Seek official product and download pages, especially those targeted at home users (not business or enterprise).
    - If the official page is unavailable or does not specify the version date, look for reputable secondary sources that reference the release date and provide official download links.
    - Accept both free and paid editions, but prioritize the home/complete edition over free-only versions.
    - Do NOT include aggregator or third-party download sites unless they link directly to official AVG resources and provide clear version/release details.
    - For each source, verify the release date—exclude anything from before 2013.
2. **Recency Check**
    - Explicitly confirm the version/release date of the AVG edition before listing it.
    - Do not include or suggest any sources or versions released prior to 2013.
3. **Version & Edition Identification**
    - Clearly note whether the offering is the full home edition, the free version, or another variant.
    - Highlight differences in features between editions, if possible.
4. **Expected Output Format**
    - Provide findings as a brief report. Use section headers for clarity, structured as follows:
        - Introduction: Summarize your approach and criteria.
        - Main Findings: List the most relevant links, specifying for each:
            - Edition/type (e.g., Home, Free)
            - Direct download link (if available)
            - Version or release date
            - Summary of offering/features
        - Additional Options: List less relevant, but still recent sources (e.g., free-only versions).
        - Table: Include a table comparing the relevant options, with columns for Source/Link, Edition/Type, Release Date, and Notes/Features.
        - Conclusion: Brief summary of the best option(s).
5. **Open-Ended Details**
    - If you cannot find explicit information on the most recent release date, list the nearest available information and note the uncertainty.
    - If the "home" edition is discontinued, suggest the closest equivalent available for home users.
6. **Language**
    - Respond in English unless otherwise specified.

7. **Sources**
    - Link directly to official AVG pages wherever possible. Avoid unofficial mirrors, forums, or unrelated third parties.

Please follow these instructions closely to ensure my primary concerns—recency and official sourcing—are met.

      4. Notes on Application Process  
         - Outline any notable information about the application process at MGH (e.g., portals used, documents required, timelines).
      5. Specialized Job Site Listings  
         - If any positions were found on specialized job sites not already listed on the MGH website, summarize them here and clarify if they duplicate positions from the official site.
      6. Sources  
         - List the URLs for the MGH careers page and any specialized job sites referenced.

5. Language
   - Respond in English.

- Include reputable sources where possible (e.g., animal behavior research centers, veterinary organizations, or official animal welfare sites).
- Include examples of expert opinions (e.g., veterinarians, animal behaviorists).
- Where available and helpful, provide short video links that illustrate cat purring in different contexts and explain their meaning.
- If any patterns or typical behaviors accompany purring (e.g., body language, situations), note them.

Open-Ended/Unspecified Dimensions:  
- No constraints on geographic origin or breed of cat—include information relevant to domestic cats in general.
- Language is not specified, so English-language sources are preferred but not required.
- No specific limit on number or length of examples.
- Video sources do not need to be from any specific platform but should be reputable and illustrative.
- All types of meanings (positive, negative, complex, etc.) are relevant.

Output Format:  
- Please provide the information as a structured report, using clear headers for each section and bullet points as appropriate for clarity.
- Include a summary or conclusion synthesizing the key findings at the end.
- Provide tables if it will help to organize the types of purring meanings, associated behavioral cues, and example contexts.
- Link directly to video resources that explain or exemplify different types of purring meanings.
- Cite all sources directly, using links to the main pages (e.g., veterinary hospitals, animal welfare organizations, or research publications).

Summary Table Example (if relevant):

| Context of Purring    | Likely Meaning                 | Accompanying Behaviors           | Example Video Resource |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Being petted         | Contentment/Relaxation        | Eyes half-closed, kneading       | [Link]                |

Objective:  
I want you to find the latest gossip specifically about Kobe Bryant. The focus should be on the most recent news or social media posts—especially those that qualify as "gossip" rather than factual or biographical data. The information must be centered on ongoing rumors, controversies, speculation, or trending stories, not on well-established or older accounts of his life and career.

Attributes & Preferences:
- **Recency:** The most important criterion is that the information is current. Consider "recent" to mean within the last 3 months unless otherwise specified.
- **Type of Content:** Prioritize posts, news articles, and social media threads classified as "gossip," "rumors," "speculation," "celebrity buzz," or similar. Avoid standard news summaries, tributes, or historic biographical information.
- **Sources:** Seek sources that are known for entertainment or celebrity news (e.g., TMZ, Daily Mail, E! News, Hollywood Life, or verified Twitter/Instagram accounts and celebrity gossip forums). If relevant, include popular or trending social media posts from platforms like Twitter, Instagram, or TikTok.
- **Language:** No language preference stated, so include sources in any language, but prioritize English-language sources unless a relevant non-English story is trending.
- **Open-Ended Dimensions:** If there is insufficient recent gossip (given that Kobe Bryant is deceased as of 2020), include any notable posthumous rumors, internet discussions, or related gossip involving his family, estate, or ongoing media narratives, making sure to clearly specify these are not current events about Kobe himself but tangentially related.

    - Columns: Date | Headline/Topic | Source (with Link) | Brief Description
- For each piece of gossip, include a short summary followed by a citation or hyperlink to the original post or article.
- If possible, differentiate by source type (e.g., mainstream media, social media, forums).
- For stories likely to be unsubstantiated or rumor, clearly note the level of reliability or verification if possible.

Additional Notes:
- Do not include general biographical information or past news unless it directly relates to a current rumor or ongoing discussion.
- If no recent gossip is available, briefly state this in the summary table and include any closest possible items (e.g., discussion of his legacy, family, etc., as outlined above).

Sources:
- Prefer direct sources: official entertainment news platforms or directly from social media accounts, not secondary rumor aggregator sites with unclear authorship.

Language:
- Provide the report in English. If significant non-English gossip emerges, translate and cite the original language/source as well.

Instructions for Researcher:

Objective:  
I want to find out the diagnostic criteria needed for a child to be diagnosed with ADHD. My specific concern is that my child has difficulties focusing at school, and I’d like to understand whether this could point in the direction of ADHD before consulting a doctor. I prefer medically reliable sites with thorough explanations of the symptoms, though brief self-check quizzes are somewhat relevant, if they come from trustworthy sources.

Requirements:

1. Medical Criteria for ADHD Diagnosis (in Children)
   - I need a clear, detailed explanation of the current medical diagnostic criteria for ADHD in children, especially according to authoritative bodies like the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition).
   - Specify and list the core symptoms—be sure to cover both inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity as outlined in the diagnostic frameworks.
   - For each symptom cluster, please provide the official criteria, the minimum number of symptoms needed, and any requirements about symptom duration, onset age, or settings (e.g. symptoms present in at least two settings, impairs functioning, etc.).

2. Relevance of School Focusing Difficulties
   - Relate the symptom of having difficulties focusing at school to the formal diagnostic criteria. Does this symptom alone strongly align with ADHD, or are more signs required?

3. Source Quality
   - Prioritize official medical sources and reputable organizations for ADHD information. Examples include:
     - American Psychiatric Association (APA)
     - CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)
     - NIH (National Institutes of Health)
     - American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)
     - Mayo Clinic
     - NHS (National Health Service, UK)
   - If providing quizzes or screening tools, ONLY use versions created or endorsed by these kinds of organizations (no generic blogs or unreviewed self-assessment tools).

4. Output Format
   - Present the information as a structured report with the following headers:
       1. Introduction
       2. Official Diagnostic Criteria for ADHD in Children
       3. Relevance of Focusing Difficulties at School
       4. Reliable Screening Tools/Quizzes (if any)
       5. References and Links to Authoritative Sources
   - If a summary table helps clarify the official diagnostic criteria (for example, listing the symptom categories, number of symptoms needed, and other requirements), please include one.

5. Open-Ended Dimensions
   - If some aspects of the criteria (such as how they may vary by country or by age group within children) are not specified, treat these as open-ended but clearly state any nuances or uncertainties you find in the guidelines.

6. Language
   - Prepare the report in English.

Summary Table Request (if applicable):

If it helps, provide a table that summarizes:
| Symptom Cluster         | Number of Symptoms Required | Duration of Symptoms   | Onset Age      | Settings Required            |
|------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Inattention            | …                          | …                     | …             | …                           |
| Hyperactivity-Impulsivity | …                          | …                     | …             | …                           |

7. Source Links
   - For major diagnostic documents or criteria, please link directly to the primary resource (e.g., APA or CDC page about ADHD).

By following these steps, I want to be able to compare my child’s symptoms with the established diagnostic criteria, judge how focusing difficulties at school fit into the picture, and know when it’s recommended to proceed to a formal evaluation.
