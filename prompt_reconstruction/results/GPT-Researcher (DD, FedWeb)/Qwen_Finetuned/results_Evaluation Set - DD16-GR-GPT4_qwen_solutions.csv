16,"What roles can robots and software play in the diagnosis and treatment of Ebola? Given that health care workers are at the highest risk of contracting Ebola while treating infected patients, what software, electronic, and mechanical devices are currently available and can be developed and used in the field. The goal is to make diagnosis and treatment as """"hands off"""" as possible, to mitigate the risk as much as possible. A number of viable robots already exist, and are used for various purposes, including disinfecting, decontaminating, handling waste, consulting between patients and doctors around the world. Government, private industry, and robotics scientists across the country are working together to adapt and implement these technologies to work in the field of medicine and the challenging conditions in West Africa.",Your task is to assess the risks associated with the deployment of rapid diagnostic tests for bio-chemical warfare agents by the California Department of Defense and Public Health. Consider the situation where such detection could be used both against military enemies and as public health measures in the event of attacks on civilians.,0.2955469787120819,0.1,"[

The attack must be physical, not just a threat or angry words. Identification or description of who or what was attacked is relevant.

Robbery and theft of medical supplies or blood samples is relevant. People raiding and looting a health center is relevant, but people storming a center to get treatment is NOT relevant.

Attacks by animal rights activists in connection with the fate of a dog belonging to an ebola victim is NOT relevant.

These can be used to protect against direct harms, improve overall quality of life, or to protect people against potential risks from which they might be vulnerable because of their physical circumstances (like living in an arid land, or in a politically unstable state).

Of interest is who she knows, where she lives, where she works, what her profession is, and who her family is. Mention of her tangentially in articles about other Ebola cases is not relevant. A comedian's jokes about her are not relevant. A caption identifying her from """"a Cafferkey family photo"""" is not relevant. Relevancy was judged based on the specificity of the information.
