1,"Who are key leaders (field grade officers and senior NCOâ€™s) in charge of U.S. military units combating the ebola epidemic in Africa, what are the protocols for personnel safety, and what is their mission? Units from all four services were deployed to West Africa, some 3000 personnel in all, in support of U.S. and international aid workers. The military was not directly involved in treating ebola patients. Their mission was to provide support services such as facilities construction, logistics, telecommunications, road building, etc. so that the medical aid workers could function more effectively. Additionally, the research addressed safety protocols for the U.S. forces, including mandatory quarantines upon return to their home bases. Non relevant information encompasses non-U.S. military units and civilian aid workers and U.S. military units that did not deploy to Africa.","www.defense.gov, www.jcs.mil,

7,"How has the movement of people from outlying rural villages to urban centers affected the spread of Ebola? Since Ebola was first discovered in 1976, the population of the affected areas in Africa has almost tripled and the percentage of people living in cities has risen dramatically. The disease hasn't changed over time, but the demographics have. Up until this latest outbreak, the disease hit mainly in rural villages, where it was more easily stopped, but now it spreads much more rapidly making it harder to contain and treat. Beyond urbanization is migration, while the virus is oblivious to borders and boundaries.","academic.oup.com, journals.sagepub.com, www.cdc.gov, sph.umich.edu, pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,

Dr. Buck was the fourth Sierra Leone doctor to become infected, and when she fell ill, there was official concern, both for her personally and for the potential depletion of the countryâ€™s medical personnel. The President of Sierra Leone formally asked the World Health Organization (WHO) to evacuate Dr. Buck to Germany for treatment. WHO refused, saying they did not have the resources to evacuate anyone but their own staff, and Dr. Buck died. Relevant information included the official involvement of the Government of Sierra Leone, WHOâ€™s response, Dr. Buckâ€™s biography, and identification of other medical fatalities in Sierra Leone. Non-relevant information included biographic details of Dr. Buckâ€™s colleagues beyond their names, medical fatalities in other West Africa countries, and treatment of foreign aid

9,"The research centered on Liberian national Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person to die of ebola in the U.S. Duncan flew to the U.S. to visit relatives in Dallas, fell ill, was initially misdiagnosed at a hospital emergency room and sent home. His condition worsened, he returned to the hospital and was correctly diagnosed, but died. Two nurses who treated him subsequently contracted ebola; both recovered. Duncanâ€™s family threatened to sue the hospital but reached a financial settlement out of court. Relevant information encompassed the postmortem repercussions, potential spread of the disease via primary and secondary contacts, Duncan's biographical information, and status of the two infected nurses. Non-relevant information included persons and activities not connected to the Duncan case, including other infected U.S. medical personnel and other fatalities in the U.S. and West Africa.","www.cidrap.umn.edu, www.cdc.gov, www.npr.org, www.dallascounty.org, en.wikipedia.org, pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, www.cnn.com, www.nytimes.com, time.com, www.history.com, www.nbcnews.com,
