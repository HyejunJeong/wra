Prompt 2: Instructions for Researching Ebola Conspiracy Theories

**Objective:**  
I want you to identify and summarize conspiracy theories circulating about Ebola. Any information specifically addressing conspiracy theories (as defined below) is relevant. You should maximize the specificity of your findings, focusing on the nature and content of the conspiracy, its alleged perpetrators and beneficiaries, the context of its circulation, and its perceived purpose or impact.

**Definitions and Scope:**

- **Conspiracy Theory (Relevant):** An event allegedly caused by powerful people or groups acting in secret to benefit themselves, as per the classic sociological definition. These should attribute intentional, covert action and self-interest to a group or authority.
- **Exclude: Hoaxes:** Information that is clearly about a hoax (a trick or prank without attribution to powerful actors for self-benefit) is not relevant.
- **Exclude: Myths:** General false beliefs or incorrect stories about Ebola not directly attributing intent or agency to powerful actors are less relevant, unless they are bundled within a conspiracy theory.
- **Exclude: Disinformation:** Only include when it specifically overlaps with a conspiracy theory as defined.
- **Degree of Relevance:** Focus especially on narratives that meet the conspiracy criteria. Information relating only to myths or hoaxes should not be included unless connected directly to a conspiracy theory.

**Attributes/Dimensions to Capture:**  
For each conspiracy theory identified, please provide as much information as possible for the following:

1. **Title/Name of the Theory**
2. **Description/Summary** (what is claimed)
3. **Alleged Perpetrators** (individuals, organizations, governments, etc., as specified in the theory)
4. **Alleged Beneficiaries** (who supposedly benefits, according to the theory)
5. **Time Period of Circulation**
6. **Principal Regions/Countries where Theory Circulated**
7. **Evidence or Supporting Claims** (provided by proponents)
8. **Notable Sources/Channels of Spread** (social media, specific websites, community leaders, etc.)
9. **References or Links to Primary Sources** (news articles, research papers, government or NGO statements, where applicable)

If any of these attributes are not mentioned in sources you find, please note them as “not specified.”

**Open-Ended and Flexible Attributes:**  
- If information about actors, time periods, or specific evidence is not specified in available sources, please indicate this.
- If the conspiracy theory is recounted in multiple versions, describe the variations.

**Formatting and Output:**  
- Organize your findings as a report.
- Use clear section headers for each theory and for summary sections.
- For clarity, include a summary table listing all identified conspiracy theories with columns for: Title, Perpetrators, Beneficiaries, Region, Circulation Period, and Brief Description.
- Under each detailed theory description, provide bullet points for the required attributes.

**Preferred Sources:**  
- When possible, link directly to authoritative analyses or reporting (e.g., peer-reviewed articles, official statements, or reputable news organizations such as BBC, Reuters, New York Times).
- Avoid aggregators or tabloidy/SEO-heavy blogs unless no primary reporting exists.
- If official WHO, CDC, or other credible health agencies address any of the conspiracy theories, link those directly.

**Language:**  
- Respond in English.

**Additional Instructions:**  
- Avoid including material that only addresses general misinformation unless it rises to the level of a conspiracy as defined above.
- If you encounter ambiguous cases (between myth, hoax, disinformation, and conspiracy), include them but flag and explain the ambiguity.

**Expected Output Example:**  
- Report format with an introductory section, summary table, and detailed sections for each conspiracy theory, each including the requested attributes and appropriate sourcing.

Prompt 7: **Instructions for Researcher**

**Research Task:**  
Investigate how the migration of people from rural villages to urban centers has affected the spread and containment of Ebola since its discovery in 1976, specifically in the context of Sub-Saharan Africa. Examine the interplay between demographic shifts, urbanization, and migration (including cross-border movement) and their combined impact on Ebola outbreaks. Emphasize how these human factors, rather than changes in the virus itself, have contributed to differences in outbreak dynamics.

---

**Key Points and Attributes to Include:**

1. **Historical Context**  
   - Briefly summarize when and where Ebola was first discovered (1976).
   - Provide a timeline of major outbreaks and note the affected regions.

2. **Demographic Changes**  
   - Quantify the population growth in the affected areas since 1976 (use census/data from reputable sources such as the UN or World Bank).
   - Quantify urbanization rates and the change in the percentage of people living in cities.

3. **Disease Spread Before and After Urbanization**  
   - Describe patterns of Ebola outbreaks in predominantly rural settings (pre-urbanization).
   - Explain differences in outbreak control and containment in rural vs. urban contexts (e.g., contact tracing, community structure, healthcare access).

4. **Rapid Spread in Urban Centers**  
   - Analyze how urban population density, transportation infrastructure, and social mobility contribute to more rapid and widespread outbreaks.
   - Discuss public health challenges unique to urban outbreaks (containment, communication, healthcare system overload).

5. **Migration and Cross-Border Spread**  
   - Explain the role of internal migration (rural to urban) and cross-border movement in the dissemination of Ebola.
   - Highlight instances or case studies where migration directly impacted outbreak size or containment efforts.

6. **Comparison to Previous Outbreaks**  
   - Compare metrics such as infection rates, containment timelines, and response effectiveness between rural and urban outbreaks.
   - Use case studies (e.g., West Africa 2014 outbreak) to illustrate these differences.

7. **The Virus and Population Dynamics**  
   - Emphasize that changes in outbreak dynamics are due to population movement and demographics, not viral evolution.

8. **Policy and Health System Implications**  
   - Describe relevant strategies and challenges for controlling Ebola in the context of increased urbanization and migration.

---

**Unstated But Necessary Dimensions:**

- **Geographic Scope:** If there is no specific country or subregion within Africa given, consider all major outbreak areas (Central and West Africa) unless otherwise specified. Clearly note this open-endedness in regional scope in your output.
- **Timeframe:** The timeframe starts in 1976 and continues to the present; use data from throughout this period to show changes over time.
- **Migration Types:** Include both internal rural-to-urban migration and international/cross-border migration in your discussion, as the user highlighted both.

   - Data Table: Major Ebola Outbreaks, Location Type (Rural/Urban), Case Numbers, Containment Duration
8. **Public Health Implications**
9. **Conclusions**
10. **References**

**Tables:**  
- Include at minimum a comparative data table listing major Ebola outbreaks, location (rural/urban), affected population size, number of cases, duration of outbreak, and main containment strategies.

**Sources:**  
- Prioritize official and primary sources, such as publications by the World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), United Nations, peer-reviewed journal articles (e.g., The Lancet, New England Journal of Medicine), and national ministries of health from affected countries.
- Link directly to government and primary data sources wherever possible.

**Language:**  
- Respond in English (the user’s query is in English).

---

**Summary of What To Do:**  
I want you to create a structured research report (with the specified headers) on how migration from rural to urban centers in Africa has changed the spread and containment of Ebola since 1976, including the additional role of cross-border migration. Use authoritative primary sources, and include a comparative data table of major outbreaks.

Prompt 11: Instructions for Researching U.S. Aid Workers Infected with Ebola After Providing Medical Assistance in West Africa

OBJECTIVE  
My goal is to identify all U.S. medical aid workers who became infected with Ebola virus while providing medical assistance in West Africa during the outbreaks (primarily 2014–2016), and to understand both the circumstances of their medical evacuation or return to the U.S. and the evolving U.S. treatment protocols for such cases. Individuals to be researched must meet the following criteria:

- They are U.S. citizens or permanent residents serving as medical aid workers.
- They contracted Ebola while serving in West Africa.
- Their repatriation to the U.S. occurred either via medical evacuation after diagnosis or before showing symptoms (i.e., pre-symptomatic cases who developed Ebola after returning).

The following are not relevant to my research:  
- Healthcare professionals who contracted Ebola inside the U.S. (e.g., through treating other patients).
- Non-U.S. persons (regardless of evacuation or treatment status in the U.S.).

   - Clearly separate findings about:
     - **Natural/Innate Immunity:** Whether any individuals or groups are born immune, why this might occur (e.g., genetic factors), and where they are from.
     - **Acquired Immunity:** If, and for how long, immunity lasts after surviving Ebola.
     - **Immunotherapy and Prevention:** Use of the immune system (e.g., antibody therapies, vaccines) in curing or preventing Ebola.

4. **Identify if Specific Groups Have Immunity**
   - Indicate (with supporting studies):
     - Who these individuals/groups are, including genetic markers or population background if identified.
     - Geographic location(s) or demographic info.
     - Any hypotheses/reasons for this immunity.

5. **Mechanisms**
   - Describe any identified mechanisms of natural or acquired immunity (e.g., specific immune system responses, genetic mutations, antibodies involved).

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. **Define Key Concepts**  
   - Briefly define "crowdsourcing" and "crowdfunding" as they pertain to internet-based initiatives.
   - Relate these definitions specifically to the context of health crises such as Ebola.

2. **Describe General Advantages Over Traditional Approaches**  
   - Clearly explain how these approaches allow broader participation, faster mobilization, and lower costs compared to established institutions (e.g., governments, NGOs).
   - Address the specific point that "deep pockets" are not required for launching such initiatives.

3. **Identify and Summarize Notable Ebola-Related Projects**
   - Research and describe several real-world cases where crowdsourcing or crowdfunding were applied to the Ebola outbreak.
   - For each example, include:
     - *Project name*
     - *Purpose or goal* (e.g., data collection, funding research, resource deployment)
     - *Platform used* (e.g., GoFundMe, Indiegogo, Ushahidi)
     - *Outcomes and impact* (e.g., funds raised, diseases tracked, innovations deployed)
   - Prioritize projects where there is clear evidence of their impact or documentation (e.g., official reports, news coverage).

4. **Create a Summary Table**
   - Compile the examples into a table with the following columns:
     - Project/Initiative
     - Platform Used
     - Purpose/Goal
     - Outcome/Impact
     - Notable Features
   - Ensure the table is easy to read and captures the range of efforts.

5. **Discuss Broader Implications and Lessons Learned**
   - Analyze what these examples reveal about the potential for internet-based crowdsourcing and crowdfunding in response to infectious disease outbreaks.
   - Note any limitations or challenges observed.

6. **Cite Sources and Further Reading**

Prompt 26: Instructions for Researching: How Did Traditional Culture Affect Efforts to Contain and Eliminate the Ebola Epidemic in West Africa?

**Objective:**  
I want you to investigate how traditional local culture influenced Ebola containment and elimination efforts in West Africa, with specific attention to ways in which recommended medical protocols conflicted with local practices and beliefs, resulting in reduced compliance and effectiveness. Your focus should remain on sociocultural interactions, not on economic analysis or the efficacy/costs of medical treatments themselves.

---

### 1. Define the Scope and Focus

- **Geographic Scope:** Focus on the West African countries most affected during the 2014-2016 outbreak (primarily Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone).
- **Time Period:** Emphasize the major outbreak of 2014-2016, but do not exclude prior or subsequent cultural insights if relevant.
- **Key Dimensions to Cover:**
  - **Traditional burial practices**: How these contributed to transmission and conflicted with public health recommendations (e.g., washing or touching corpses).
  - **Role of community elders and influential locals**: How their participation or lack thereof impacted communication and acceptance of containment protocols.
  - **Stigma and suspicion**: Local perceptions of Ebola, patients, and foreign health workers; cultural beliefs about disease causation.
  - **Aid worker cultural competency**: To what extent international responders adapted protocols to local beliefs and whether interventions were successful when cultural liaisons, translators, or anthropologists were involved.
  - **Education and messaging strategies**: How culturally-resonant educational materials or the use of trusted local figures influenced outcomes.
- **Explicitly Exclude**: Economic impacts, cost analysis of treatments, or detailed pharmacological discussion unless directly connected to cultural beliefs (e.g., suspicion toward Western medicine).

---

### 2. Identification and Collection of Sources

- **Prioritize Primary Sources:**
  - Official reports by WHO, MSF, CDC, and similar agencies describing field experiences regarding cultural challenges.
  - Firsthand accounts (news reports, interviews, testimonies) from local health workers, anthropologists, and community leaders.
  - Peer-reviewed journal articles focusing on anthropological or public health perspectives (e.g., The Lancet, Social Science & Medicine).
- **Secondary Sources (if primary sources are insufficient):**
  - Credible academic reviews and reputable NGO analyses.
- **Languages:** English is preferred unless specific relevant material is only available in French or local languages (in which case, note this explicitly).
- **Exclude**: General news overviews focused on economics, medical efficacy, or purely biomedical content without sociocultural context.

---

### 3. Data Extraction and Organization

- **Extract and Synthesize Information on:**
  - **Specific cultural practices** that conflicted with Ebola safety protocols.
  - **Documented examples** where these conflicts led to protocol avoidance or adaptation.
  - **The impact of involving community elders, religious leaders, or respected locals** in aid efforts.
  - **Successes and failures** in adapting public health messaging to local culture.
  - **Cases where anthropological insight improved outcomes.**
- **Organize your findings into major themes,** each with concrete, referenced examples.

---

### 4. Output Format and Structure

Prepare a clear, structured **report** with the following sections and organize with appropriate headers:

1. **Introduction**
   - Briefly state the research question/objective and importance of understanding cultural impacts during epidemics.
2. **Overview of Traditional Cultural Practices Related to Ebola Spread**
   - Burial/funeral customs
   - Beliefs about disease causation
3. **Interaction Between Medical Protocols and Local Culture**
   - Points of conflict and consequence for protocol adherence
4. **Role of Community Elders and Respected Locals**
   - Examples and effectiveness of their involvement in health education/messaging
5. **Foreign Aid Worker Cultural Awareness and Stigma**
   - Challenges and approaches
   - Positive and negative outcomes of anthropological involvement
6. **Cultural Sensitivities Around Corpses**
   - Specific significance and adaptations attempted by health workers

8. **Conclusion**
   - Synthesize main findings on the influence of traditional culture on the Ebola response.
9. **References**
   - List all sources, with preference for direct links to official agency reports or journal articles.

---

### 5. Additional Notes

- If a relevant dimension (e.g., specific ethnic group customs) is not specified in my instructions, treat it as open-ended and include all variances you find.
- Do NOT include analysis of economic impacts or deep biomedical treatment mechanisms unless directly related to sociocultural issues.
- Where possible, use direct quotations from primary sources to illustrate cultural challenges or strategies.
- Provide all URLs for online references and specify if a source is only available offline or in a non-English language.
- If you find that tabular illustration will help present the information (especially for comparison of interventions and adaptations), please make sure to include such tables.

**If any component of the research objective is unclear or not adequately specified, treat it as open-ended, document any ambiguities, and ensure comprehensive coverage of possibilities rather than making assumptions.**

Prompt 27: Here are instructions for how I want you to complete my research task:

Task Overview  
I want a detailed summary of what happened to Kaci Hickox, a U.S. nurse who treated Ebola patients in Liberia, when she returned to the United States via Newark, N.J., and was designated as the first person quarantined under New Jersey’s Ebola prevention/containment policy. The research should focus strictly on actions by New Jersey and Maine state officials, Kaci Hickox’s responses, and public opinion on her case. Please do not include information about the treatment, condition, or views of any other medical volunteer, nor about policies or actions taken by other states.

Instructions

1. Scope and Focus  
  - Only include information about Kaci Hickox, not about any other medical professionals.
  - Limit your coverage to actions or statements by officials from New Jersey and Maine only.
  - Limit the time frame to the duration of Hickox’s involvement with quarantine policies—her arrival in Newark, the quarantine in New Jersey, her transfer to and quarantine in Maine, and conclusion of formal legal actions (if any).
  - Cover Kaci Hickox’s public responses, statements, legal actions, and media appearances during this period.
  - Incorporate public opinion specifically about Hickox’s quarantine and response; use polling data, major newspaper articles’ commentary, or representative op-eds if available.
  - Do NOT include any information about other states’ policies, broader national Ebola policy, or information about other cases.

2. Key Dimensions to Analyze  
  - Chronology: Provide a clear, step-by-step timeline of key events (arrival, quarantine, legal threats, transfer, home quarantine, resistance, ending of quarantine).
  - Official Actions: Describe the actions and public statements of New Jersey and Maine officials, citing official announcements and orders where possible.
  - Hickox’s Response: Summarize her objections, her legal actions or threats, public statements, and interviews.
  - Public Opinion: Summarize both support and criticism, citing representative sources (editorials, polls, etc.) specific to Hickox, not general quarantine or Ebola policy.
  - Resolution: How the situation concluded, including any legal outcomes.

3. Expected Output Format  
  - Please format your output as a report with clear headings for: “Introduction,” “Timeline of Events,” “Actions by New Jersey Officials,” “Actions by Maine Officials,” “Kaci Hickox’s Response,” “Public Opinion,” and “Resolution and Outcome.”

  - Provide a table summarizing the timeline of events with columns for “Date,” “Event/Action,” and “Relevant Parties.”
  - Include direct links to primary sources where possible (e.g., official press releases, court documents, articles from major newspapers).
  - List all sources at the end of the report.

4. Open-Ended Dimensions  
  - If details such as specific legal outcomes or the wording of official orders are not available, note them as such and summarize what is available.
  - If no relevant poll data or public opinion survey can be found, substitute with representative editorials or commentary.

5. Language  
  - Please provide your response in English.

6. Sources  
  - Prioritize direct links to official state government releases, court documents, and major national newspapers (e.g., New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal) for coverage of events and public reaction.
  - Avoid linking to SEO-heavy blogs, non-reputable outlets, or summaries not based on primary reporting.

Summary Table Example:

| Date        | Event/Action                                     | Relevant Parties      |

| Oct 24-27, 2014 | Quarantined at Newark hospital facility      | Hickox, NJ officials |
| ...         | ...                                              | ...                  |

Please follow this structure and level of detail to address my research request thoroughly and accurately.

Prompt 28: **Instructions for Researching Changes in the Distribution of Arctic Permafrost**

**Objective:**  
I want you to determine whether the **distribution** of permafrost is changing in the Arctic. My focus is specifically on shifts in geographic location, area, and boundaries of permafrost zones, not just on the general impacts or total volume/extent.  
I'm aware that many sources address the *impacts* of changing permafrost rather than mapping/coherent documentation of changes in "distribution" itself. Your task is to address the gap by locating, synthesizing, and explaining what is known about the **changing geographic distribution** of Arctic permafrost.

---

**Required Approach:**

1. **Define “Permafrost Distribution”:**
   - Clearly summarize what is meant by ‘distribution’ in current research (e.g., spatial/geographic extent, boundaries between zones, continuous vs. discontinuous permafrost).
   - If there is ambiguity or multiple definitions, note these and how they affect analysis.

2. **Data and Sources:**
   - Search for satellite observations, field surveys, and synthetic mapping studies that explicitly document CHANGES IN DISTRIBUTION — such as maps, time-series, or boundary shift analyses.
   - Prioritize primary literature (peer-reviewed journal articles, mapping projects, government/academic research reports).
   - Reference official or authoritative sources where possible (NOAA, NASA, NSIDC, national geological surveys, etc.).
   - If you find only secondary or review sources, note this limitation but include their synthesis.
   - Where relevant, provide direct links/citations to the most recent or comprehensive maps and datasets.

3. **Time Frame:**
   - Specify the periods covered in the data (e.g., pre-1990s vs. present; multi-decadal trends).
   - If longitudinal data/maps are available, present changes over time.

4. **Geographic Scope:**
   - Ensure your coverage includes the main Arctic permafrost regions (e.g., Alaska, Canada, Siberia, Greenland, Nordic Arctic).
   - Note any gaps or unevenness in geographic data availability.

5. **Synthesis:**
   - Summarize the nature and magnitude of observed distribution changes (e.g., retreating southern boundary, reduction in area of continuous permafrost).
   - If quantitative data (area lost/gained, shift in boundary in km) is available, include this.
   - If changes are only inferred or modeled (not directly observed), make this distinction clear.

6. **Visualization:**
   - Provide side-by-side comparative maps, figures, or tables if possible—showing changes in distribution over time.
   - If possible, include or create a table summarizing key studies, their findings, geographic focus, and data sources (see table example below).

7. **Formatting:**
   - Format the final output as a **mini-report** with the following headers:
     - Introduction and Definitions
     - Methods and Data Sources
     - Observed Changes in Permafrost Distribution
     - Regional Highlights / Case Studies
     - Summary Table of Key Studies (include columns for Study, Year(s), Data Type, Geographic Scope, Main Findings, Source/Link)
     - References and Further Reading

8. **Open-ended Dimensions:**
   - If you discover that data is limited or ambiguous, or that definitions vary, address these as open questions and note where further research is needed.
   - Do not restrict to a specific climate scenario or projection method unless the source itself does so.

---

**Additional Notes:**
- If you find interactive datasets or monitoring projects (e.g., the Permafrost Carbon Network, IPA), provide links or instructions for access.
- For visual content (maps/charts), ensure permissions/attribution is respected, or summarize/map in your own table if copying is not allowed.

---

**Summary Table Example:**

| Study / Dataset           | Year(s)      | Data Type     | Geographic Scope    | Key Findings on Distribution Change                  | Source/Link                 |
|---------------------------|--------------|---------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Brown et al.              | 1990–2020    | Satellite/Model| Pan-Arctic          | Southern boundary of continuous permafrost retreated by ~X km | [link]            |
| IPA Permafrost Map        | 2000–2020    | Synthesis Map | Global/Arctic       | Shrinkage in discontinuous permafrost area            | [link]                      |

---

**Deliverable:**  
A structured mini-report, including a summary table, that provides the clearest available answer to whether—and how—the distribution of permafrost in the Arctic is changing, with references or links to primary sources and maps where available.

Prompt 29: RESEARCH INSTRUCTIONS

Objective:  
I want to identify which ice sheet is contributing most to sea level rise, determine whether the ice sheet is growing or shrinking, investigate whether the change in ice sheet melting rate is location-dependent, and summarize available data sets to analyze ice sheet melt.

Instructions Format:  
Please provide a structured report using clear headers for each question:

1. **Which Ice Sheet Is Contributing Most to Sea Level Rise?**
   - Compare the major ice sheets (primarily Greenland and Antarctica) in terms of their current contributions to global sea level rise.
   - Include quantitative data (e.g., gigatonnes/year, mm/year to sea level rise) from recent peer-reviewed studies or authoritative scientific reports.
   - Cite sources directly within the section and provide direct links to primary sources (e.g., NASA, IPCC, ESA, original journal articles).

2. **Is the Ice Sheet Growing or Shrinking?**
   - For each major ice sheet, state whether it is currently growing or shrinking overall.
   - Present data on mass balance trends over the past decade, specifying values and trends (e.g., mass lost per year, acceleration/slowdown, uncertainty ranges).
   - Reference global scientific agencies or major publications (e.g., IPCC AR6, NASA GRACE, ESA CryoSat, Nature, Science).

3. **Is the Change of Ice Sheet Melting Rate Dependent on Location?**
   - Explain regional variability within and between the major ice sheets (e.g., West Antarctic Ice Sheet vs. East Antarctic; northern vs. southern Greenland).
   - Provide recent findings or consensus on the spatial drivers of melting (e.g., ocean warming, surface temperature, ice-ocean interactions).
   - Use maps or tables as appropriate. If helpful, please include a table comparing major regions and their melting rates.

4. **What Is the Available Data Set to Analyze Ice Sheet Melt?**
   - List and describe the major publicly available datasets that are used to study ice sheet melt (e.g., NASA GRACE/GRACE-FO, ESA CryoSat, Operation IceBridge, ICESat-2, IMBIE).
   - For each dataset, include information on:
     - What type of data is provided (e.g., gravimetric, altimetry, radar, laser)
     - The time span covered
     - Accessibility and where to find/download the data (provide direct links)
   - Present this information in a summary table for clarity.

General Guidelines:
- If there is any ambiguity or lack of specification—such as which ice sheet (Greenland or Antarctic), time frame, or resolution—treat all possible major ice sheets and base on the most recent available data.
- Cite the most recent and authoritative sources: prioritize links to official agency sites, peer-reviewed journals, or major climate science assessments (i.e., IPCC).
- Do not include or prioritize aggregator sites, news summaries, or blogs.
- Present information in clear, non-technical language suitable for an informed but non-expert reader.
- Use tables and figures where they would enhance clarity, especially for question 3 (regional melting) and question 4 (datasets).

Expected Output Format: Report with sections matching the above questions, use tables as indicated, and provide direct citations and hyperlinks to major sources.

Prompt 30: Instructions for Researching the Location of Basal Boundary Conditions in East Antarctica

**Objective:**  
My goal is to identify where basal boundary conditions have been located or studied in East Antarctica. I am specifically interested in documented locations or mapped instances of basal boundaries, as well as the types/comments on the boundaries (melting, freezing, etc.). The search must focus on *East Antarctica as a geographic unit* and avoid results for other Antarctic regions or partial matches.

**Instructions:**

---

### 1. **Clarify Definitions and Research Parameters**
   - Define "basal boundary conditions" (e.g., temperature conditions, presence of liquid water, melt/freeze, sliding vs. frozen bed, etc.). Note in your output what definitions are used in each study if possible.
   - Specify that *East Antarctica* refers to the continental region east of the 0° meridian, not just the eastern part of Antarctica.
   - State that, unless otherwise specified, I am open about the time period (contemporary or past studies are both acceptable).
   - If the basal boundary condition type (e.g., melting vs. frozen vs. mixed) is not specified, include that as “unspecified” and treat it as an open dimension.

### 2. **Database and Source Selection**
   - Use advanced search operators where possible (AND, phrase search, field-specific search) to ensure that "East Antarctica" is considered as a geographic unit.
   - Prioritize academic databases such as Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar.
   - Search key Antarctic-specific journal titles (e.g., *The Cryosphere*, *Journal of Glaciology*, *Geophysical Research Letters*).
   - Review institutional or collaborative research programs like the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration, BEDMAP2/BEDMAP3, SCAR, and relevant national Antarctic programs.
   - Use official data repositories (e.g., NSIDC, Australian Antarctic Data Centre) for maps and datasets.

### 3. **Construct Search Queries**
   - Use the exact phrase "East Antarctica" in quotes to ensure search integrity.
   - Combine with ("basal boundary" OR "basal conditions" OR "bed conditions" OR "basal thermal state" OR "subglacial interface").
   - Exclude terms/regions not of interest if supported by the search engine (e.g., -West -Peninsula -Ross).

### 4. **Screen and Extract Studies**
   - Screen for relevance by confirming studies are set in East Antarctica and analyze basal boundary conditions specifically.
   - Extract the following mandatory details for each relevant study:
     - **Study/Source Title**
     - **Authors**
     - **Date**
     - **Specific Location within East Antarctica** (e.g., Dome C, Lambert Glacier, etc.; include lat/long or spatial coordinates if provided)
     - **Type of Basal Boundary Condition Studied or Identified** (melting, frozen, mixed, etc.)
     - **Methods Used** (e.g., radar, seismic, borehole, modeling)
     - **Key Findings**
     - **Source/Link (pointing to original, official, or publisher site; avoid blog summaries)**

   - If a study presents a map or summary table of basal thermal states across East Antarctica, extract or reproduce the relevant map or recreate a table of locations and conditions.

### 5. **Organize Results in a Table**
   - I expect you to organize the findings into a clearly structured table with at least the following columns:

| Study/Source | Authors | Year | Location (specific/glacier/region/coordinates) | Basal Condition Type | Method | Key Finding | Source Link |

   - Add any additional columns if you find another attribute is commonly reported and useful for comparison.

### 6. **Summarize Key Patterns or Gaps**
   - Briefly summarize, in standard prose, any patterns in location (e.g., “studies are clustered near major research stations such as Concordia and near large outlet glaciers such as Lambert Glacier”), as well as notable gaps (regions of East Antarctica without published basal boundary data).
   - Note limitations in coverage or consistency, especially if studies use varying definitions or methods.

### 7. **Output Formatting**
   - Present your results as a concise report structured with clear headers:

Prompt 32: INSTRUCTIONS FOR RESEARCHER

Task Overview:  
I want you to investigate and document the sensitivity of polar oceans to changes in freshwater inputs. You should focus on how changes in freshwater fluxes (from sources such as melting ice, river discharge, and precipitation) affect the physical and/or biogeochemical circulation of the polar oceans—both the Arctic and Antarctic. Additionally, I am interested in collecting documents and data specifically related to freshwater flux and its effects on ocean circulation in these regions.

Please follow the instructions below exactly and comprehensively:

---

## 1. Clarify and Frame the Research Question

- The core research question is: **How sensitive are the polar oceans (both Arctic and Antarctic) to changes in freshwater inputs?**
- Document any direct measurements, modeling studies, or review articles that explicitly address this sensitivity—both qualitatively (e.g., descriptions of process) and quantitatively (e.g., estimates of thresholds or modeled scenarios).

## 2. Key Attributes and Dimensions to Address

Include the following aspects in your research:

- **Defining “Sensitivity”**: How sensitivity is quantified (e.g., in terms of salinity change, circulation alteration, sea ice extent, stratification, biological impacts, etc.).
- **Freshwater Sources**: Main sources of freshwater (e.g., ice melt, river runoff, precipitation, glacial outflow).
- **Ocean Circulation Impacts**: How freshwater inputs impact:
   - Thermohaline circulation (including the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation for the Arctic)
   - Stratification and mixing
   - Deep water formation
   - Sea ice formation and melt cycles
- **Regional Variation**: Note any differences in sensitivity between the Arctic and Antarctic oceans, or within different parts of each polar region.
- **Temporal Scale**: Consider both seasonal/interannual variation and longer-term (decadal/century) trends.
- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Document any feedbacks (e.g., albedo changes, ice–ocean feedbacks) highlighted in the literature.
- **Open-Ended Dimensions**:  
   - If the form of sensitivity measurement (observational, modeling, proxy-data, etc.) is not specified, include all types.
   - If end-user application (e.g., climate forecasting, ecosystem impact, policy) is not defined, be inclusive but explain any implications or gaps.

## 3. Literature and Data Sources

- Target **peer-reviewed journal articles**, official scientific datasets, major assessment reports (e.g., IPCC reports, AMAP, SCAR), and primary data from agencies such as:
   - NASA, ESA, NOAA, NSIDC for observational data
   - National or international polar research institutes
- Avoid SEO-heavy/secondary sites except for context or pointers to primary sources.
- Where possible, **link directly to open-access or primary reports, datasets, or journal articles**.
- If you find review articles that summarize the field, include those as well.
- Summarize and reference datasets related to direct measurements of freshwater flux (e.g., river discharge records, satellite altimetry, GRACE/ICESat data for ice mass loss).

## 4. Output Structure and Formatting

Format your output as a structured report, suitable for a scientific or policy audience, with the following sections:

**A. Executive Summary**  
Brief summary synthesizing the main findings regarding the sensitivity of the polar oceans to freshwater input.

**B. Background**  
Definitions and importance of freshwater flux in polar ocean systems.

**C. Mechanisms and Processes**  
Detailed overview of mechanisms by which freshwater inputs affect polar ocean circulation and structure.

**D. Synthesis of Observational and Modeling Studies**  
Comparison table summarizing key recent (last 10–15 years) studies with columns:
   - Citation
   - Polar Region (Arctic, Antarctic, or both)
   - Type of Study (Observational/Modeling/Review)
   - Freshwater Source(s)
   - Sensitivity/Impact Results
   - Main Conclusions
   - Link to Source

**E. Data and Document Resources**  
List and briefly describe available data products and major documents/reports (with links), including:
   - Datasets on freshwater fluxes (e.g., Arctic river discharge data, satellite ice mass loss)
   - Major relevant review/assessment reports

**F. Open Questions and Research Gaps**  
Briefly summarize any gaps, uncertainties, or open research areas as identified in the literature.

**G. References**  
Full citations for all documents and data sources used.

## 5. Notes and Constraints

- Since I have not specified a language, use **English** in your report.
- If you identify that tables enhance clarity or comparison (e.g., comparing studies, data sets), provide them.
- Where possible, **link directly to official sources** (e.g., NASA, NSIDC, primary journals).
- Do not limit to a particular time frame or region unless the source is naturally constrained.
- Treat all other attributes (study methods, outcome focus, etc.) as open-ended unless specifically addressed in this instruction.

Prompt 52: Instructions for Researcher

Objective:  
I need to understand how the albedo feedback amplifies future climate change at the Poles. Specifically, I want:  
- An explanation of the mechanism of albedo feedback that relates to amplifying climate change in polar regions (i.e., the Arctic and Antarctic).
- Details on what kinds of datasets are useful to analyze both current and future albedo in these regions.

FORMAT:  
Please structure your response as an organized, clearly headed report with the following sections:

1. **Executive Summary**  
   - Briefly summarize the main points about albedo feedback and its impact on polar climate change.

2. **Albedo Feedback Mechanism at the Poles**  
   - Explain what albedo is, and how it relates specifically to solar radiation in the polar regions.
   - Describe the feedback loop: Detail the physical mechanism by which melting snow and ice reduce albedo, how this leads to increased absorption of solar energy, and how that further accelerates warming.
   - Explicitly tie the explanation to polar amplification (i.e., why the Poles experience greater temperature increases than the global average due to this feedback).

3. **Datasets to Analyze Current and Future Albedo**  
   - List and describe types of datasets that would be useful for studying albedo at the poles.  
   - For each dataset type, include:
     - Temporal coverage (historical, current, projected future)
     - Spatial resolution and coverage (Arctic, Antarctic, both)
     - What variables are measured (e.g., surface reflectivity, snow/sea ice extent, wavelength-specific albedo, seasonal variation)
     - Data sources or examples of prominent datasets (e.g., MODIS, CERES, AVHRR, CMIP6 climate model output, etc.). If possible, link to the official dataset or its documentation.
   - If applicable, ask the researcher to present this information in a comparative table for clarity.

4. **Conclusion**  
   - Summarize the connection between albedo feedback, polar warming, and the importance of robust albedo datasets for monitoring and projecting future climate change.

Additional Guidelines:
- Do NOT assume any specific region (Arctic/Antarctic) preference unless detailed in the query; cover both Poles unless stated otherwise.
- If future projections are discussed, clarify the types of models and scenarios typically used.
- Use plain English suitable for someone with a background in environmental science or physical geography, but not necessarily an expert in radiative feedbacks or climate modeling.
- Cite sources, prioritizing links to original datasets or reputable institutional websites (e.g., NASA, NOAA, ESA, IPCC).

If you find a table would help with dataset comparison, please include it in the report.
